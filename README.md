# Tile-Designer---Java-
Tile Designer 
When this application first appears, the user will see one bar of shapes (which we call it the tile bar) across the top, and a gridded square region of 5*5 empty squares in the center. 
The user can click on any of the shapes on the tool boar to select one tile .
The user then can click in the design area. If the mouse is clicked in one of the 25 squares, that particular grid will be filled by the currently selected tile.
